                <br>

                <p>In emerging regions, particularly in Africa, there are the urban cities, the metropolis, the suburbia and then there are the rural towns and villages; those who wake every day, clinging to hope yet being far from its realities and dividends even as they strive to move to the cities in search of pastures that can be organically “grown” within their communities. This reality has become the bane for rural-urban migration. The rural communities, in essence, see migration as hope for a brighter future.</p>
                     <br>
               <p>In sharp contrast, the rural areas in developed regions such as Europe and North America seem more like destinations for rest, leisure and eventful retirement. Yes, there is less economic activity, but there’s awareness, education, thriving enterprises, opportunities for people of all age ranges and most importantly, there are the basic infrastructures that make life meaningful and possible for rural dwellers.</p> 
                           <br>
               
              <p>As a team of community-passionate experts who know that rural towns are not synonymous with poverty in most parts of the world, except here in the regions of West Africa, we are eager to rewrite the narratives and build better communities through media awareness and education.</p> 
                           <br>
              
             <p>Over the decades, the gap in communities’ capacity to express their experiences, and grievances at the grassroots level has unfortunately expanded. The social disconnect is quite alarming, considering these stakeholders form the bulk of modern society, especially within the Nigerian polity. They form the living numbers on all election dates; Women, men and young people year in year out having expectations in administrations and systems that fail them consistently because for so long, these communities have been without a unified platform and voice to demand accountability and quality governance from their political officeholders. </p> 
                           <br>
            <p> Communities have been kept in the dark and trapped by the weapons of illiteracy, poverty and religious bias by ill-meaning leaders and stakeholders who seek only personal interests at the expense of their immediate and larger constituents. These</p>
